## Experience
### Software Developer at Visma Solutions, Helsinki - Current employment
Developing a Rest API in C#. My responsibilities include everything back-end related from database maintenance to unit testing to debugging to designing and creating new features within the continuous delivery pipeline while contributing to scalable, maintainable code.

## Education and studies 🎓
**Software Engineering, Hive Helsinki**
Studies involve deep dive into C and C++ programming. The studies started with building a custom standard library, and have since progressed to creating my very own bash, as well as a ray-caster from scratch.

**Game Development, Windesheim University of Applied Sciences, Zwolle**
This minor focused on game algorithms, computer graphics, C++, and concluded with a game project. It covered various techniques vital in game development, ranging from goal driven decision making and fuzzy logic and pathfinding.

**Business Information Technology, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki**
The studies combined practical IT skills, enhanced teamwork, communication and self-reliance. I majored in OO-programming, server operations, and database design.
