**Software Engineering, Hive Helsinki**
Studies involve deep dive into C and C++ programming. The studies started with building a custom standard library, and have since progressed to creating my very own bash, as well as a ray-caster from scratch.

This minor focused on game algorithms, computer graphics, C++, and concluded with a game project. It covered various techniques vital in game development, ranging from goal driven decision making and fuzzy logic and pathfinding.
